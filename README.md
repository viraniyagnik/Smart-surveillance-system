# Smart surveillance system
 Capstone Project
  Name: Yagnik Virani
  

Python API using Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, Temperature Humidity Sensor, Motion sensor

Developed a hardware system that utilizes a Raspberry Pi-4B as a control unit, programmed using Python, to monitor for suspicious activity on-premises. The system includes a motion detection feature which allows the camera module to record short videos, a temperature and humidity sensor for fire detection, and a Python script that automatically sends the recorded videos to a registered user's email and stores them on the cloud. Additionally, if a fire is detected within the monitored area, an alert is automatically sent to all registered users.
