# Smart surveillance system
 Capstone Project
  Name: Yagnik Virani
  

Python API using Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, Temperature Humidity Sensor, Motion sensor

The objective of this project is to develop hardware that can monitor suspicious activity on-premises. Raspberry Pi-4B is used as a control unit and with the help of Python the board is programmed to meet the given specification. The system used motion detection, which enable the camera module to record short videos and the Python script automatically delivers that video to the Microsoft Azure cloud server. This monitoring system also sent email with storage link for the administrator review via the internet.
